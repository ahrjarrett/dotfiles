Or, my notes on how to turn a 4-hour grind into a 1-hour workflow.

* Preflight Checklist

** TODO Clean up files

- [ ] Go through Documents & Downloads folder
- [ ] Go through Library/Contacts folder
- [ ] Big files like videos, tutorials & audio recordings go to Drive, Dropbox
- [ ] Notes & org-mode files go to Dropbox
- [ ] Documents, designs & current reading list go to iCloud
- [ ] $HOME folder, miscellaneous config files go to iCloud
- [ ] Copy .env files for bkwds, AWS apps, DigitalOcean & Pineneedles to iCloud dir
- [ ] eBook library goes to bitbucket

** TODO Clean up projects

- [ ] Make sure you've committed and push all branches of active projects
- [ ] Make sure there are no orphans without remotes that you care about
- [ ] .env files! Double check that you got them all.
- [ ] Go through ~stuff~ directory, ugh -- /don't be a packrat/
  
** TODO Backup dotfiles_stash

Make a quick sweep and grab what you can.

Add to iCloud at ~./$HOME/dotfiles_stash~ via Finder with copy/pasta.
  


* Reformat that puppy!

This article seems like what I want: a no fuss, no recovery option for reformatting:

** TODO Add docs on best practices, some quick dos and don'ts


- What can be automated?

- What kinds of OS X scripts are out there that will do all of this for me?

- I tried Thoughtbot's developer install and there was too much magic. Need to configure my own.


* Reinstall Checklist

** TODO Install & Configure Chrome

*** Tips & Tricks

*Tip:* If you're ever looking to configure Chrome, [[chrome://chrome-urls]] is my favorite place to start.

It's basically a sitemap for everything configurable in Chrome. From there I access links like these:

1. [[chrome://bookmarks]]
2. [[chrome://flags]] -- /super neat stuff Chrome will do, if you know to ask/
3. [[chrome://network-errors]]
4. [[chrome://omnibox]]
5. [[chrome://signin-internals]]
6. [[chrome://site-engagement]] -- /basically a report card of which sites waste your time/
7. [[chrome://user-actions]] -- /keep this open and it will log of your actions in the background. cool./
8. chrome://quit -- /alt-f4 turns on god mode/

   
*** TODO Get Chrome Baseline Usable

- [ ] Install Vimium, upload ~vimium-settings.json~ file
- [ ] Log into Google accounts
- [ ] Check installed extensions against list below
- [ ] Import your bookmarks (or dare to start fresh?)
- [ ] Add custom Styler files (see section below)
- [ ] (Optional) Go through flags list

*** TODO Extension List

Go to [[chrome://extensions]] to see and configure your extensions

- [ ] JSONView -- /Configure:/ Allow incognito; Extension Options: Add dark theme
- [ ] Module Linker (for Github packages)
- [ ] Extension Icon React Developer Tools
- [ ] Styler Classic 
- [ ] React DevTools
- [ ] Redux DevTools -- /Configure:/ Allow access to file URLs = interactive debugging
- [ ] Vimium -- /Configure:/ See Vimium section
- [ ] +Open Multiple URLs+
- [ ] +Rearrange Tabs+
- [ ] +Reason Tools+
- [ ] +Surfingkeys+ -- /like a more powerful Vimium, with a steeper learning curve/
- [ ] +Yesware+
- [ ] +New Tab Redirect+ -- /Old redirect:/ [[chrome-extension://dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb/pages/options.html]]
- [ ] +Google Docs Offline+ -- /creeped me out/

In a file called ~random-configs.org~, or something obnoxious like that.

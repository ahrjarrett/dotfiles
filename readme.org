My notes, scripts and dotfiles for setting up my dev environment on a new computer or a fresh OS X install.

- Fresh machine? See [[https://github.com/ahrjarrett/dotfiles#instructions][Instructions]].
- Reformatting? See [[https://github.com/ahrjarrett/dotfiles#preflight-checklist][Preflight Checklist]].
- Here's a nice guide on [[https://mac-how-to.gadgethacks.com/how-to/reformat-mac-os-x-without-recovery-disc-drive-0155591/][erasing and reinstalling OS X]].

* How it works

Upon bootstrap, every file and folder in this repo is symlinked to your home directory.

Exceptions:

1. It's an ~.org~ or ~/.md~ file (documentation)
2. It lives inside the ~/.excludes~ directory (things desktop wallpaper go here)
3. It lives inside the ~/.scripts~ directory (the bootstrap file calls scripts in here)
4. It's something you'd typically add to a ~/.gitignore~ file (for example ~/.DS_Store~)

* Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. /Read the scripts/. You could catch on fire, your mom would be disappointed, etc. etc.
3. When you're ready run ~sh bootstrap.exclude.sh~

That's it! See the Postinstall Checklist below if something went wrong or you need a more thorough configuration.

*Note:* It's worth mentioning that ~scripts/brew_install.sh~ /forces/ all GUI application installations. Meaning if an app already exists in the Applications folder, it will be removed and reinstalled.

* Preflight Checklist

Reformatting your machine? Do these things first:

** TODO Clean up files

- [ ] Go through Documents & Downloads folder
- [ ] Go through Library/Contacts folder
- [ ] Big files like videos, tutorials & audio recordings go to Drive, Dropbox
- [ ] Notes & org-mode files go to Dropbox
- [ ] Documents, designs & current reading list go to iCloud
- [ ] $HOME folder, miscellaneous config files go to iCloud
- [ ] Copy .env files for bkwds, AWS apps, DigitalOcean & Pineneedles to iCloud dir
- [ ] eBook library goes to bitbucket

** TODO Clean up projects

- [ ] Make sure you've committed and push all branches of active projects
- [ ] Make sure there are no orphans without remotes that you care about
- [ ] .env files! Double check that you got them all.
- [ ] Go through ~stuff~ directory, ugh -- /don't be a packrat/
  
** TODO Backup dotfiles_stash

Make a quick sweep and grab what you can.

Add to iCloud at ~./$HOME/dotfiles_stash~ via Finder with copy/pasta.


* Postinstall Checklist

So you just ran the scripts. Here's some stuff you might consider next:

** TODO Configure Chrome

- [ ] Import your bookmarks (or dare to start fresh?)
- [ ] Add custom Styler files from [[marketplace_customizations][https://github.com/ahrjarrett/marketplace-customizations]] repo
- [ ] [Optional] Go through tips & tricks section

*** TODO Install Extensions

Visit [[chrome://extensions]] to see and configure your extensions

- [ ] +Google Docs Offline+ -- /creeped me out/


*** TODO Chrome Settings

**** Customize URL Bar Queries

*Shortcut:* 

1. In Chrome do ~Cmd + ,\~  or navigate to [[chrome://settings]] 
2. then search for "Manage Search Engines"

*My Custom Queries:*

| Search engine          | Keyword | Query URL                                            |
|------------------------+---------+------------------------------------------------------|
| Chrome Pages           | chr     | chrome://%s                                          |
| deselectOmnibox        | q       | javascript:                                          |
| deselectOmnibox        | z       | javascript:                                          |
| Drive Images           | img     | https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/search?q=%s       |
| GitHub                 | gh      | https://github.com/search?q=%s&ref=opensearch        |
| MarketPlace            | zz      | http://admin.austin.ownlocal.com/businesses?query=%s |
| marketplace ad search  | oo      | https://louismagdaleno.com/?q=%s                     |
| marketplace biz search | bz      | http://admin.austin.ownlocal.com/businesses/%s       |
| Chrome Pages           | chr     | chrome://%s                                          |
  

*** Tips & Tricks

*Tip:* If you're ever looking to configure Chrome, [[chrome://chrome-urls]] is my favorite place to start.

It's basically a sitemap for everything configurable in Chrome. From there I access links like these:

1. [[chrome://bookmarks]]
2. [[chrome://flags]] -- /super neat stuff Chrome will do, if you know to ask/
3. [[chrome://network-errors]]
4. [[chrome://omnibox]]
5. [[chrome://signin-internals]]
6. [[chrome://site-engagement]] -- /basically a report card of which sites waste your time/
7. [[chrome://user-actions]] -- /keep this open and it will log of your actions in the background. cool./
8. chrome://quit -- /alt-f4 turns on god mode/

**** Flags (Experimental)

[[chrome://flags]]

Here are some I like to turn on. User beware, read what they do first, etc etc.

| Latest stable JavaScript features            | #disable-javascript-harmony-shipping | Enabled |
| 3D software rasterizer                       | #disable-software-rasterizer         | Enable  |
| Debugging for packed apps                    | #debug-packed-apps                   | Enabled |
| Hardware-accelerated video decode            | #disable-accelerated-video-decode    | Enabled |
| Creation of app shims for hosted apps on Mac | #disable-hosted-app-shim-creation    | Enabled |



** DONE Install OS X Apps

This step is no longer done manually. If you ran ~bootstrap.sh~ then all of these apps were installed for you.

If the bootstrap failed you'll want to double check that each of these were installed:

- [x] Chrome [[https://www.google.com/chrome/b][Download]]
- [x] Dropbox [[https://www.dropbox.com/install][Download]]
- [x] Emacs (copy from iCloud if borked)
- [x] Keycastr [[https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr][Download]]
- [x] Sequel Pro [[https://sequelpro.com/download][Download]]
- [x] Sketch [[https://www.sketch.com/get/][Download]]
- [x] Slack [[https://slack.com/downloads/mac][Download]]
- [x] Spectacle [[https://www.spectacleapp.com/][Download]]
- [x] Spotify [[https://www.spotify.com/download][Download]]
- [x] The Unarchiver [[https://theunarchiver.com/][Download]]
- [x] VLC [[https://www.videolan.org/vlc/][Download]]
- [x] VS Code [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=osx][Download]]

** DONE Symlink dotfiles & configure shell

This step is no longer done manually. 

If it turns out you're missing something from the dotfiles repo, check the iCloud backup you made before reformatting:

~iCloud/$HOME/dotfiles_stash~


* Random configs + secrets

None of my config secrets live on Github.

Check iCloud for a file called ~random-configs.org~, or something obnoxious like that.

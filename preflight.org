Reformatting your machine? Do this first:

** TODO 1. Clean up files

- [ ] Go through Documents & Downloads folder
- [ ] Go through Library/Contacts folder
- [ ] Big files like videos, tutorials & audio recordings go to Drive, Dropbox
- [ ] Notes & org-mode files go to Dropbox
- [ ] Documents, designs & current reading list go to iCloud
- [ ] $HOME folder, miscellaneous config files go to iCloud
- [ ] Copy .env files for bkwds, AWS apps, DigitalOcean & Pineneedles to iCloud dir
- [ ] eBook library goes to bitbucket

** TODO 2. Clean up projects

- [ ] Make sure you've committed and push all branches of active projects
- [ ] Make sure there are no orphans without remotes that you might care about
- [ ] ~.env files~! Double check that you got them all.
- [ ] Go through project directory (~stuff~, ~code~), and ugh -- /don't be a packrat/
  
** TODO 3. Backup dotfiles_stash

Make a quick sweep and grab what you can.

Copy/pasta what you find to an iCloud folder named ~dotfiles_stash~
